Why this proposal:
- clean up the repository, remove duplicate STL files
- make it easier to adapt changes to parts like bearings, electronics, endstops, ... and encourage people to release their changes or addons to prusamendel under the same license.

While doing it, the documentation HOW to print a prusa mendel and it's variations need to be updated.


Directory draft:

base-metric/ - will contain every part you need minimally to get printing, minus the extruder 
base-metric/lm8uu  - custom parts for lm8uu 
base-metric/lme8uu - custom parts for lme8uu/igus drylin 
extruders/[name]/ - files for extruders
endstops/[type]/ - for different kind of endstops people use
misc/[subdirs]/ - for other stuff like electronic mounts, spool holders, printable bushings and whatever wonderful ideas people have.
